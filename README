Hello Ookla hiring management team! I realized that I have a project that better demonstrates my skills after linking to this one. Please see here: https://github.com/MCLindner/CosmoFit/blob/main/CosmoFit.ipynb

RUNNING WHATSUP:
Open the WhatsUp directory and run WhatsUp.py: 
python WhatsUp.py
or 
chmod +x WhatsUp.py then ./WhatsUp.py

OUTPUTS:
A list of the currently visible stars and constellations will be generated in the Outputs folder, along with a plot of the right ascentions and declinations of the visible objects.
